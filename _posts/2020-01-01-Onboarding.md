Onboarding is different from the orientation. Orientation plans will last for few weeks however, onboarding will last for six to one year.

Generally, the onboarding process starts from the day candidates receive the offer letter. It is a good idea to create a portal for the new joinee to let know about the company culture and also inform the reception and the departments about the new joinee for the necessary arrangements before joining. 

Similarly, on the date of joining he needs to be comfortable along with his teammates. A general introduction with the team along with their responsibilities and a team lunch will make the candidate feel comfortable. The process of receiving feedback and assigning a mentor needs to there for the next six months, so that the candidate feels welcomed in the team and culture of the company. 

At the end of the year, based on their performance and feedback of the immediate supervisor the career path need to be developed or sadly they don't fit in with the culture, vision, and mission of the company.

To sum up, if the onboarding process goes as per the set timeline the new joinee will be a long term assets for the company and thankful towards the set career path of success.
